# Overview

password-encrypter takes a *base*, *secondary*, *integer* and *skull key* to generate a password hashed from a combination of those four parameters. The intent is to store and maintain a different *base*, *secondary*, *integer* for every account and use this app to find the password.

I've been using algorithm generated passwords for a while now, but have always wanted a more secure system that used hashing.

This website makes no server calls and is all done in browser. It's for personal use but feel free to fork and run your own version. I would not recommend using someone else's instance of this for your own password management. You should understand the code and have complete control over the process.
